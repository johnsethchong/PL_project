# This is a project I've made using my work history at Pacific Life
I manually kept track of the work I processed between 2014 - 2020. Due to privacy, the data used was very limited. I was only able to perform an analysis using dates, the type of policy given the policy number, and the processing done.

I performed a Python analysis by reading in each CSV file and created a standard dataframe template for consistency. By creating a standard, it allowed me clean the data in such a way that I was able to easily combine 11 different dataframes into one master dataframe, CareerComplete. Once created, I was able to perform an analysis to show many different things, such as: how many of each policy types I worked on, the amount of work I've performed per month/year, my busiest day, and more. Data Visualizations were created using the Matplotlib library and include multiple bar & pie charts
